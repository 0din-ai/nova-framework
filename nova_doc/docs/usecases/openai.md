# Analysis of ChatGPT Prompts

If your users use OpenAI's ChatGPT, you can extract logs directly from the web interface under your account settings.

# OpenAI Logs

OpenAI allows each user to export their conversation logs via Settings. NOVA doesn't natively parse OpenAI logs, but you can manually parse them from the command line and run NOVA against the extracted prompts.

Use the following command:

```bash
cat conversations.json | jq -r '.[].mapping | to_entries[] | .value.message? | select(.author.role? == "user") | .content.parts[] | select(. != null)' | while read -r prompt; do python novarun.py -r nova_rules/basic_rule.nov -p "$prompt"; done
```

You will see output similar to this:

```bash
